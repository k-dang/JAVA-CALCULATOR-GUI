JAVA-CALCULATOR-GUI
===================
A simple calculator made on java using the swing library(GUI), can do simple calculations and has a switch to change from
integer mode to float mode. This was an assignment for a course, so most of the code was provided.However I had to modify 
the functionality of the buttons so that operators would perform correct actions and change the operator classes so that 
they would follow object oriented programming
